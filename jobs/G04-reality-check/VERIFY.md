# Verification in progress

`cat README.md RULES.md JOBS.md CLAIMS.md` on current main: read; lowest
unclaimed G04 after fresh G01/G02/G03 lines. Claim0d43479 pushed to main.
`git switch -c job/G04-reality-check-core`: new branch from main; existing
research-only job/G04-reality-check branch preserved.
`gh api repos/<source>/readme` and contents/doc paths: four source texts read,
commit snapshots pinned in SOURCES.md. No game checks claimed yet.

Required remaining: full strict types/contract properties,1000 seeded games
per count,independent10,000-case hardest-function diff,25 mutations,2,000-game
bot comparisons,all fixtures,offline HTML/TV/phone/reduced-motion/capture,
checksums,actual current-head green CI,PR and KEEP GOING.

Initial `npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund --cache /workspace/.npm-cache`
at repo root failed EUSAGE: the workshop root has no package lock. Re-run
from jobs/G04-reality-check uses its pinned lock; no root manifest invented.

Job-directory npm ci:PASS,eight pinned packages installed. `npm run check`:PASS.
`node generate.ts` then `node generate.ts --check`:160 rows,20/realm,valid
schema,byte-identical regeneration. `node differential.ts`:10,000 seeded
cases plus14 edges,ZERO mismatches; unit scale/reciprocal/zero/overflow pass.
Initial native schema import in tests failed ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND at shared
minigame-schema; resolved by bundling the actual schema in preflight.ts.

`FAST_TEST=1 node --test --test-name-pattern='fooled-vote credit is independent'
test.ts`:before correction FAIL(actual1000,expected1500). After additive
truth awards, `FAST_TEST=1 node --test test.ts`:22/22 PASS.
`node fixtures.ts`:all seven phases plus matching manifest generated.
`node checksums.ts` / `node checksums.ts --check`:PASS.
Full property/21,000 count-and-mode games and12,000 league matches underway;
no result presumed. Browser,mutations,full npm test and CI remain unfinished.
